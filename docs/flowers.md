# Flowers Rubric Operations Guide

## Photo context tips
- Prioritize recognition output for flower varieties and architectural elements; mention only details the model confirms.
- Reference the time of day or setting when EXIF or operator notes clearly establish it, but avoid speculating beyond captured context.
- Operator previews now append the EXIF capture date to the info block above each caption, so rely on that timestamp when you need to cite shooting conditions.
- When multiple photos appear in a carousel, call out the hero frame explicitly (e.g., "First photo" or "Cover shot") so editors can map feedback to assets.

## Weather interpretation
- Use the rubric's synthesized morning/day/evening conditions to shape greetings and avoid reacting to minor forecast noise.
- Highlight pleasant streaks or notable shifts (storms clearing, sunshine returning) but skip commentary on negligible temperature swings.
- If weather data is missing or stale, pivot to evergreen compliments and omit explicit forecasts.

## Tone and delivery
- Keep greetings optimistic and conversational, reserving urgent alerts for severe weather notes from the scheduler.
- Pair botanical details with sensory language (color, fragrance, scale) to maintain warmth without sounding flowery or exaggerated.
- Close with a gentle call-to-action when relevant (e.g., encouraging submissions or tagging growers) while respecting channel guidelines.

## Seasonal asset selection
- Filter candidate assets by the requested season and permit neighbors (e.g., spring pulls late-winter and early-summer photos) only when the primary season queue is empty. The preview should call out when a fallback season photo appears so editors can double-check the vibe.
- Attempt up to ten unique asset combinations before shrinking the media group. Each retry swaps in fresh photos that still pass the seasonal gate, so degradation happens only after the pool truly runs dry.
- When the generator finally reduces the number of frames, expose an "Attempts" counter in the operator preview header (e.g., `Attempts: 7/10`) so staff understand how aggressively the system searched before downgrading.
