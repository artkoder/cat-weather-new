# Flowers Rubric Operations Guide

## Photo context tips
- Prioritize recognition output for flower varieties and architectural elements; mention only details the model confirms.
- Reference the time of day or setting when EXIF or operator notes clearly establish it, but avoid speculating beyond captured context.
- Operator previews now append the EXIF capture date to the info block above each caption, so rely on that timestamp when you need to cite shooting conditions.
- When multiple photos appear in a carousel, call out the hero frame explicitly (e.g., "First photo" or "Cover shot") so editors can map feedback to assets.

## Weather interpretation
- Use the rubric's synthesized morning/day/evening conditions to shape greetings and avoid reacting to minor forecast noise.
- Highlight pleasant streaks or notable shifts (storms clearing, sunshine returning) but skip commentary on negligible temperature swings.
- If weather data is missing or stale, pivot to evergreen compliments and omit explicit forecasts.

## Tone and delivery
- Keep greetings optimistic and conversational, reserving urgent alerts for severe weather notes from the scheduler.
- Pair botanical details with sensory language (color, fragrance, scale) to maintain warmth without sounding flowery or exaggerated.
- Close with a gentle call-to-action when relevant (e.g., encouraging submissions or tagging growers) while respecting channel guidelines.
